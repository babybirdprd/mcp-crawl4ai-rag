Current Behavior:

The system works best with focused, single-concept queries
Returns many results (up to 50+) but with varying relevance
Struggles with compound queries asking about multiple concepts
Results are most useful when matching specific documentation sections
Quality of results is better with natural language but focused queries
Desired Behavior:

Should handle compound queries about multiple related concepts effectively
Should maintain high relevance even with increased match_count
Should understand context across multiple related concepts
Should provide comprehensive results that cover all aspects of a complex query
Should be able to synthesize information from different documentation sections
Current vs Desired Examples:

Current:

Query: "Grid layout configuration, scale animations, stagger timing, z-index management"
Returns mostly unrelated content
Struggles to find comprehensive solutions
Results are scattered and less practical
Desired:

Same query should:
Return a cohesive set of results covering all aspects
Provide complete implementation examples
Show how different concepts work together
Include both high-level concepts and practical details
Implementation Gaps:

Current: Limited to matching single focused concepts
Desired: Should be able to understand and retrieve related concepts in context
Current: Results quality varies with match_count
Desired: Should maintain consistent relevance regardless of result count
Recommendations for Improvement:

Enhance query understanding to handle compound concepts
Improve context awareness across related documentation sections
Better synthesis of information from multiple sources
More sophisticated relevance ranking for complex queries
Better handling of result count vs relevance tradeoff
This comparison highlights the limitations of the current implementation while clearly defining what would make it more effective for complex queries and comprehensive information retrieval.
